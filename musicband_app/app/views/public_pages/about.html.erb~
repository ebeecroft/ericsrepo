      <td>It was in high school that I formed my first band.  I started out on rhythm guitar, but like most new bands we had to have a bass, so I became a bass guitarist.  Eventually my co-founders all left for college and 8to 5 jobs.  I continued playing with several different bands and spent years on the road traveling to gigs in the Northwest and Canada. After settling down to marriage, a family, and an 8 to 5, I stopped playing and sold all my gear.  About eight years ago I was introduced to “Olde School”, and have enjoyed getting back into music once again.</td>

      <td>Charlie started the Olde School Band in 2004 while working at Mountain View Middle School to play at community events and fundraisers. He had played in similar bands while teaching at Department of Defense Schools in Germany and Japan from 1989-2001 and missed that weekly “rock and roll therapy”. Charlie played the guitar off and on since he was in 7th grade with the heaviest playing years in the 1970’s while in the army and since the 1990’s when he started playing in bands. In the early days he played a 12 string and sang quite a bit of folk and country mixed with songs from Simon and Garfunkel, Crosby Stills Nash and Young, Dylan, and others. His friend and bandmate Dave convinced him to buy his Epiphone Casino in 1999 which was better suited to some of the rhythm and blues and rock they were playing at the time. Charlie does vocals on songs from the Eagles, Stones, The Band, and a variety of other artists from the 60’s though the 90’s. Charlie always says, “I bought a PA and surround myself with people with a lot more talent than I have so I get to play and have fun.” And fun is what it is all about.</td>

      <td><p>Liz Zanze grew up playing the flute, starting at the age of 10.  She lived with her family in San Jose and was able to play in several groups through high school.  She traveled to Japan with the San Jose Youth Symphony in 1972 and enjoyed performing with the orchestra.  Liz went to SF State to complete her BA in music, and she loved going to the jazz clubs in the City and taking in all of the culture.  Liz  started playing music in the Bay Area back in 1976, playing in big bands that performed in San Francisco.  She played in a big band led by a leader named Nick Jordan, who would later become his boss.  Liz was often the only girl in the band and had a tuxedo outfit she would wear to the gigs.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Liz moved to the Sacramento area with her husband Brian in the early 80’s, joining rock bands that included the all girl band,  NoBoy and jazz duo called Take Five.    Liz studied the flute and saxophone through college and began playing the bass in the early 1980’s.  She enjoys playing rock, jazz and classical music and is happiest when she is jamming  with her friends.  Liz teaches music in the Redding area and participates in several bands and ensembles in Redding.    She currently plays jazz with the Shasta College Jazz Band and Dick Turners “Fever” jazz septet  and classic rock n’ roll with Olde School.  Playing music is a blast!</p>

      <td>Peter grew up playing guitar singing Beatles and Stones and writing his own songs. Raising a family as a full time teacher, he continued his guitar playing on Sundays in Church. All of his son are musicians, so when Charlie asked him if he knew of any drummers, Peter said," Well I have a drum set in the garage, I could learn to keep a beat on skins." And that is how it happened. The guitar player became a drummer and the rest is history. Well, not much history, yet.</td>

      <td><p>Brian was about 12 years old in 1963 when popular music began a dramatic change with the likes of Chuck Berry,  Elvis, The Beatles, the Rolling Stone, Bob Dylan and Ray Charles to name just a few.  Watching these artists and others on the Ed Sullivan show was a revelation to him. That was the moment Brian knew he had to play the guitar and sing.   “I had been singing in the church choir and playing trombone in the school band, so I had the music basics and a family friend had given my older brother an old Kay F-hole acoustic guitar and that was the catalyst that I needed!”  Brian’s older brother, Scott taught him the basic on the guitar and the rest, as his mother would remind him, was just about practicing.  “I remember my very first song that I played on the guitar; it was The House of the Rising Sun, as done by the band the Animals. It was a great song to learn because it had more than the typical three chords of most  rock/blues songs.”  When Brian was asked why he began singing and playing the guitar, he replied, “to impress the girls, of course!  I once told a young lady that I played guitar and she responded...’who doesn’t’ “, sarcastically.</p>
          <p>“I ordered my first electric guitar from the Sears & Roebuck mail order catalog, and paid for it with my paper route earnings.  Wow, was I trilled when it finally arrived two weeks later.  Now, I had the electric guitar, but no amp to play it through”, Brian lamented.</p>
          <p>“I was very lucky to have wonderful music mentors in my life and supportive parents.  My high school band teacher, Bill Dwyer, was not only a great guitar player, but a wonderful person and friend.  I played in and organized many garage bands in my youth, my first band played in the corridor of the middle school for the lunch break.  My very first shot of performance adrenaline. We knew and  played only  two songs,’ For Your Love’ by the Yardbirds and ‘As Tears go by’, by the Stones.  I was hooked!  Fortunately, I lived in a small town and we could still have Saturday night dances in the school gym, or the local ‘slot car track’ or church social hall. So my high school band(s), in its many morphs, had plenty of venues to hone our sound and practice our craft.  Our peers had little choice, because we were one of the few, if not the only band in town!  Eventually, the serious players and I were able to put together a band that had some chops (including my music teacher Bill, my brothers Wick and Scott) and we played most weekends and summer at an upscale (in a rural kinda way) lodge, restaurant and lounge located in the country just  outside our little town,  during my last high school years and college summer breaks. “</p>
          <p>Brian reflected, “Wow, it has been great fun and I have met so many wonderful people and made many friends along the way.  I have played in pop bands, a brother band, country band, a band playing songs of the 30’s and 40’s, and now a retro rock band called Olde School, playing cover songs of the 50, 60 and 70’s! I am so glad I was inspired to learn to play the guitar!  Life is better when you embrace and perform music, it is truly the universal language.”</p>
